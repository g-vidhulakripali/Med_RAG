# Technical Report: Agentic RAG System with LangGraph

## System Architecture and Design Decisions

### 1. Overall Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

- **Frontend Layer**: Streamlit-based web interface for user interaction
- **Orchestration Layer**: System manager coordinating all components
- **Agentic Layer**: LangGraph-based RAG agent with autonomous workflows

- **LLM Layer**: Multi-provider language model management

### 2. Key Design Decisions

#### 2.1 LangGraph Integration
- **Rationale**: LangGraph provides robust workflow management and state persistence
- **Implementation**: 5-node workflow (retrieve → analyze → generate → evaluate → improve)
- **Benefits**: Autonomous decision-making, conditional routing, and self-correction

#### 2.2 Multi-LLM Strategy
- **Primary**: Google AI Studio/Gemini API (free tier, high quality)
- **Fallback**: OpenAI API (reliability, consistency)
- **Implementation**: Automatic provider switching with retry logic
- **Benefits**: Redundancy, cost optimization, performance flexibility

#### 2.3 Vector Storage Selection
- **Choice**: Chroma (in-memory with persistence)
- **Alternatives Considered**: FAISS (performance), Qdrant (scalability)
- **Decision Factors**: Ease of integration, metadata support, development speed

#### 2.4 Document Processing Strategy
- **Chunking**: Recursive character splitting with overlap
- **Size**: 1000 characters (optimal for medical text comprehension)
- **Overlap**: 200 characters (maintains context continuity)
- **Metadata**: Comprehensive tracking for source attribution

### 3. Pipeline Components and Interactions

#### 3.1 Document Processing Pipeline
```
PDF Input → Text Extraction → Preprocessing → Chunking → Vector Embedding → Storage
```

#### 3.2 Query Processing Pipeline
```
User Query → Retrieval → Analysis → Generation → Evaluation → Improvement (if needed)
```

#### 3.3 Component Interactions
- **SystemManager** orchestrates the entire pipeline
- **DocumentProcessor** handles PDF extraction and chunking
- **VectorStore** manages embeddings and similarity search
- **RAGAgent** executes the LangGraph workflow
- **LLMManager** provides LLM access with fallback mechanisms
